# 	There are three value types: String, number and boolean. 
# 	Array types are marked with "[]".
# 	If the name for a key, (key: value), ends with "FILE", the FILE_STUB value will be prepended to it. This is so you don't have to repeatedly write out the entire path
# 	No no colons, ":", allow in key names
